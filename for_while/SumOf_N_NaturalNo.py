# 1. Sum of First N Natural Numbers
# A teacher wants to reward students by giving points daily. On day 1, a student gets 1 point, day 2 → 2 points, and so on. This follows a natural number sequence.
# Write a program to calculate the *total points earned after n days* by summing all natural numbers up to n using loops.

# Input: n = 10
# Output: Total Points = 55


#Method 1 for loop
# n=int(input("Enter the number : "))
# sum=0;
# for i in range(1,n+1):
#     sum+=i
# print(sum)    

#Method 2 while loop

n=int(input("Enter the number : "))
sum=0;
i=1
while i<=n :
    sum+=i
    i+=1
print(sum)
